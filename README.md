This is the *Meal Planner (Java)* project I made myself.


<p>Every day, people face a lot of difficult choices: for example, what to prepare for breakfast, lunch, and dinner? Are the necessary ingredients in stock? With the Meal Planner, this can be quick and painless! You can make a database of categorized meals and set the menu for the week. This app will also help create and store shopping lists based on the meals so that no ingredient is missing.</p>
